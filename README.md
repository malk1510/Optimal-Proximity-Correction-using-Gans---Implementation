# Optimal-Proximity-Correction-using-Gans---Implementation

## VLSI Mask Optimization using GAN-based OPC | Self Project | May 2022 - June 2022
• Implemented Optical Proximity Correction (OPC) Resolution Enhancement Technique, using a GAN model.
• Utilized a UNet architecture for the Generator, with Subpixel Super Resolution for the DeConvolution layers.
• Performed pretraining for the Discriminator model using Inverse Lithographic Training, through Lithosim.
